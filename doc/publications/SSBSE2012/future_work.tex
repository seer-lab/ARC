\section{Future Work}

Targeting the variables, functions and classes on the error path is another
feature we would like to add. It has shown great success in helping to isolate
and automatically fix bugs in single-threaded programs~\cite{FNWG09, WNLF09,
NWLF09, WFGN10, GNFW11, LDFW12}. We believe it will do the same for multi-
threaded programs.

We also plan to experiment with new operators. Potential additions include
splitting or merging synchronization blocks and adding new locks. Through
experimentation we plan to optimize the existing set of mutation operators to
maximize their capabilities.  An intriguing possibility is adding crossover to
the algorithm, changing it into a genetic algorithm.

Many new concurrency structures were introduced in Java 5. Expanding ARC's
operators to deal with new anti-patterns~\cite{BJ09, FKLV12, BCD06} gives ARC
the ability to fix additional types of bugs.

We plan to optimize ARC's approach to reduce the time taken for finding a fix.
One idea is to short-circuit the identification of a correct individual, as
currently ARC only identifies a solution after evaluating all individuals of
the current generation.
