As stated above, ARC isn't quick.  We plan to optimize issues around speed: Immediate evaluation of potential fixes - instead of at the end of a generation, memory caching and mutation creation on demand, instead of exhaustively.  An intriguing possibility is adding crossover, changing ARC into a genetic or gene expression algorithm.

Targeting the variables, functions and classes on the error path is an important feature 
we would like to add. It has shown great success in helping to isolate
and automatically fix bugs in single-threaded programs~\cite{FNWG09, WNLF09,
NWLF09, WFGN10, GNFW11, LDFW12}. It should be straight forward to integrate a
static analysis tool~\cite{HP04, NPSG09, NWLF09} like Chord.  We seed the first generation with mutants from the target area and grow the search from there.

We plan to experiment with new operators. Potential additions include
splitting or merging synchronization blocks and adding new locks. Through
experimentation we plan to optimize the existing set of mutation operators to
maximize their capabilities.  Many new concurrency structures were introduced in Java 5. Expanding ARC's
operators to deal with new anti-patterns~\cite{BJ09, FKLV12, BCD06} gives ARC
the ability to fix additional types of bugs.
