Automatic repair of single-threaded programs is being realized in practice.
Similar progress has not been made on the automatic repair of parallel
programs. We introduce a fully automated system for repairing deadlocks and
data races in parallel Java programs. The approach works on any Java source
code and requires only rudimentary test cases. Annotations, formal
specifications or other notations are not required. As only the concurrency
mechanisms are targeted the semantic meaning of the program is not changed. An
evolutionary strategy is used to mutate the existing program until a variant is
found that fixes the deadlocks and data races.
%As the first
%phase may introduce unneeded synchronization, a second phase attempts to
%optimize performance by removing the excess synchronization without sacrificing
%program correctness. We describe the approach and report on early results.
