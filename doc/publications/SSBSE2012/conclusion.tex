\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Little work has been done on automatically fixing parallel programs. We
introduced ARC -- a framework that automatically fixes deadlocks and data races
in parallel Java programs. We've implemented a test prototype that we are
continuing to develop and refine.  Experiments were conducted to evaluate ARC
using a set of 8 programs drawn from the IBM concurrency benchmark. It was able to
fix the data races and deadlocks in all 6 of the fixable programs and find optimal fixes
for 5 of them.  

ARC faces a number of challenges: Efficient use of noise making tools like ConTest,
scalability and further testing.   We have learned a great deal from this experience. 
Many ideas have come from the
initial testing and checking of results. Going forward we plan to refine existing 
features, add new ones and continue to test ARC against a wider array of larger 
programs.  First on our list is the addition of  a second phase that attempts to 
optimize the efficiency of the fixed programs.
