\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Little work has been done on automatically fixing parallel programs. We
introduced ARC -- a framework that automatically fixes deadlocks and data races
in parallel Java programs. We've implemented a test prototype which we are
continuing to develop and refine.  Experiments were conducted to evaluate ARC
using a set of 8 programs found in a (IBM?) concurrency benchmark. The results
indicate that ARC is \ldots
% TODO

In the future we plan to add a second phase that attempts to optimize the
efficiency of the fixed programs.

%It uses an evolutionary algorithm operating in two
%phases. Bugs are fixed in the first phase, then concurrency is optimized in the
%second.
