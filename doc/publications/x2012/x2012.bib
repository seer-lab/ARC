        transformation and the resulting Promela code would be evaluated by the model checker SPIN. By
        allowing the model checking to occur straight from the source code, model checking can used more
        widely. The correctness of the translator was assessed by seeding faults into a concurrent
        example, which was then discovered by Java PathFinder.

        This paper introduces Java PathFinder which is a very popular model checker in the research
        community. The tool described in this paper is of the earlier version of Java PathFinder. It is
        interesting to see the evolution, motivation and design rational for this tool. The paper
        presents a nice example which explains in great detail how this translation works. The concept of
        translating a modern programming language into a modeling language is great as it proves it can
        be done to other languages.}

        to perform a transformation into Promela which then was evaluated by the SPIN model checker. This
        version of JPF operated directly on the Java bytecode, which allows for all of the features of
        Java to be understood. This is implemented by using a modified version of the Java Virtual
        Machine to perform the model checking. Java PathFinder is built using static and dynamic analysis
        tools to help catch data races and deadlocks in concurrency code. There is planned work to
        incorporate more search algorithms and extensions into this tool.
        \\ \\
        This paper shows the improvements over the previous version of Java PathFinder. The concerns of
        how the language could not be fully modeled in the previous version discourage the use of a
        translation. The solution to this was bytecode, which is quite interesting since Java PathFinder
        is now fully contained within Java. The description of the algorithms and the components that
        Java PathFinder use is noteworthy, as well as the future work which is to optimize by improving
        the abstraction and slicing efforts to reduce the number of states required to explore. }

        guided search algorithm executed in parallel. Hopper also includes a visualization toolkit to
        illustrate the analysis of the model. This randomized guided search only randomizes a set of the
        top priority states to explore. This limits the problem of state exploration, while still
        exploring more of the state-space randomly. This search algorithm proves to be successful in
        reducing the number of transitions need to find an error.

        This paper exposes another model checking tool, one which builds off of another tool. This
        extension process is encouraging as it shows that there is promise in expanding on existing tools
        within the model checking community. The randomized guided search algorithm that was presented is
        quite unique as it is randomizing only the top selection of the priority queue of next states.
        This effectively reduces the number of states while retaining the guided search.}

        the area of concurrency testing. This approach presents various benefits to the search since it
        is not hindered by keeping track of the states. The only problem is the reduction in verification
        of the bug, states allow for much better replay in model checking. The techniques and rationals

        influence the model. By focusing around these funnels the easy states of the model can be
        translated into an AND-OR graph that can be evaluated by Lurch. The results are promising as the
        resources consumed are smaller then existing model checkers, though there is a possibility of
        missing an error. 
        \\ \\
        Given the common problem of resource consumption in model checking, a lightweight alternative is
        well needed. The idea that Lurch presents is quite interesting, basically focusing the search of
        the model to a subset and then randomly search this reduced focused model. It would be interesting
        to see it used in more of a concurrency bug detection experiment.}
